# Background and Motivation

For most of my life I have been into exercising, but for most of my life I was not consistent
and I never got into lifting weights. It was not until the fall of 2017 were it became
important to me as a lifestyle and now I do it almost every day. My motivation was I had
realized how much better I felt after a good workout. It was then that I put the pieces
together; those of exercising, eating right, the various stimulus one might encounter in a
day and how one reacts to said stimulus can affect your day to day wellness.
I strongly believe that one can prevent even conquer ailments such as stress and depression with the above remedies.
This is what guided me to finding the ‘Lifestyle_and_Wellbeing_Data’ on kaggle.com.

# Data

The ‘Lifestyle_and_Wellbeing_Data’ was gathered using 12,757 survey responses, from July

BMI range, to do lists completed, flow, daily steps, life vision, sleep hours, lost vacation
days, daily shouting, sufficient income, personal awards, time for passion, daily meditation,
age, and male/female.
